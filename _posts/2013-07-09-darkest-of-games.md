So a friend of mine, let's call him Red, has been bugging me to create a Let's Play series together. Two weeks ago we finally decided on a game. The very mediocre shooter 'Darkest of Days' (though it really has some potential). The first two episodes are up, and we're trying to keep a schedule where we upload a video every Thursday and Sunday. As this is our very first youtube series we had no idea how to do a lot of things. For example we wished we started with a game that's more fun :P! Anyway let us know what you think of it, and please subscribe to stay up to date!
