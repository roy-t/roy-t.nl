As I've mentioned in a <a title="OpenGL Slides" href="http://roy-t.nl/index.php/2011/03/20/opengl-slides/">previous post</a> I've been working a lot with OpenGL lately for a CG class. Every week we gave a presentation about some features and implementation details, to bad a lot of it is too much out of context if you haven't followed the class. However I've found a few slides about cool-to-warm shading (<a title="Amy Gooch Paper" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.28.277&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">a technique by Amy Gooch</a>) and edge detection that are separate enough to post here, I hope it's useful!
