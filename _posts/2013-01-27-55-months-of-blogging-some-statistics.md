Fifty-five months ago <a title="My first post!" href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2008/08/27/Simple-On-demand-Content-Loading-in-XNA.html">I thought I had a brilliant idea for XNA's ContentManager</a> so I opened a blog on wordpress.com. A few hours later my thoughts of brilliance were shattered when someone told me the improvements I made were already there (hidden from view). Anyway I decided to continue writing tutorials and technical articles. A few years later I moved the entire blog to http://roy-t.nl where it is now. Today I was studying for a course on statistical pattern recognition. This got me thinking. Except for sometimes tallying up all the views I hadn't done any analysis of the total impact on the internet I made. Of course it's just a drop in the ocean, but I'm pretty pleased. The statistics:

Total views: <strong>259.587</strong>, which averages nearly <strong>5000 a month</strong>, in this month I expect over <strong>6000</strong> views

Total comments: <strong>435</strong>, nearly <strong>8 a month</strong> (OK that is not too much, but as a tutorial site most people just hit and run!)

Total posts: <strong>120</strong> (including this one), averaging  a bit over <strong>2 a month</strong>. Currently I aim at one post per month but some months its hard to keep up!

Income from adds and donations: E 70,- (A long time ago I removed the donation button and the adds)

Total video views:<strong> 22.289</strong>, or<strong> 4397 minutes</strong>

Awards won: <strong>1 </strong>(2nd place in the SgtConker XNA Tutorial contest)

Offers to write a book received: <strong>2</strong> (Not kidding, publishers approached me to write introductory books about XNA 4, unfortunately I didn't had the time to write one, and I'm not 100% sure I'm qualified enough)
