The next couple of months I will be doing an internship at <a href="http://abbeygames.com/">Abbey Games</a> the creators of the highly successful game <a href="http://reusgame.com/">REUS</a>. I'll be working on technology for their 'next big thing' which I can't talk about yet because even I don't know what it is going to be :). I hope to be able to do an 'internship post-mortem' after I'm done where I can at least showcase a bit of what I've worked on.
