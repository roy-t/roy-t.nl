Apart from code on this blog, I haven't really contributed code on other places on the web. However, a blog really isn't the best place to put code. So I've dusted off my Atlassian account and I'll be starting to make contributions on BitBucket.

You can find my BitBucket account on: <a title="BitBucket Account" href="https://bitbucket.org/roy-t/" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/roy-t/</a> the place is a bit barren at the moment, but I hope to make some progress on my Roslyn / Code Constraints experiment this weekend. I'll publish the changes there.

Of course feel free to contribute or pull the code and check it out!

*Update: I've switched to [GitHub](https://github.com/roy-t)*
