While I'm finishing up my master's degree studying Navigational Meshes and Path Finding I spent some of my free time with a friend developing a prototype for a game. Because we've been working on this for a while I thought it would be time to spice up the graphics a bit. During the last two weeks I developed a cool looking 2D lighting and shadowing technique that is much akin to deferred rendering.

I hope I can find the time to convert my test-code into a tutorial but for now you'll just have to make due with this awesome videos, a few references and the source code (C# / XNA)
