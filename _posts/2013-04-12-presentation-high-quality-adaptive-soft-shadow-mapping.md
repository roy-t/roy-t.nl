So I've been extremely busy following courses in Advanced Graphics and Multi-modal Interaction. So I haven't had time to produce content especially for this blog. I would like to write somewhat of a closer/best off for XNA, a tribute for the good times and fun I had with it. But as I said, time is a rare commodity these days. Soon I hope to show you advanced shader voodoo to do path tracing on the GPU. (You might have seen some screen shots on twitter) but since that is also part of an assignment for a course I can't share it yet.

For now I will just leave you here with a presentation on soft shadow mapping, which uses back projection onto the light source. A very interesting notion I thought.

The presentation can be found <a href="http://roy-t.nl/files/High_Quality_Adaptive_Soft_Shadow_Mapping.pdf">here</a>

The original paper can be found <a href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/guenneba/SoftShadowMapping_eg07.php">here</a>
