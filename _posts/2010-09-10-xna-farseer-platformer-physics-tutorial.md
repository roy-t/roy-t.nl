My XNA Farseer platformer physics tutorial is up and online at <a href="http://www.madgamedev.com/post/2010/09/09/Article-XNA-Farseer-Platform-Physics-Tutorial.aspx">MadGameDev.com</a>

Below is a sneak preview, but follow the above link for the complete article.
<blockquote>Today I’m going to introduce you to a neat 2D physics engine for XNA called Farseer. With the help of this 2D physics engine we are going to create a small platform ‘game’ while introducing the important concepts of Farseer like bodies, geometry, joints and springs.
