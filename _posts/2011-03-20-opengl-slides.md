Sorry that I haven't been posting much lately! I've been working my ass of at the first (finally) computer graphics class at my University. Had to wait until my 3rd year but I'm going all out now.
(too bad though that it isn't directX or XNA even, but hey, can't have everything ;) ).

Anyway for this class I've made a quite a few slides about OpenGL. Most of it doesn't make sense if you haven't followed the exact same course and did the assignments but a few topcis (input buffer, fps-style camera movement and DOF using shaders) where separate enough so that I could put them up here as slides, I hope they benefit some people! (All the thumbnails are clickable)
