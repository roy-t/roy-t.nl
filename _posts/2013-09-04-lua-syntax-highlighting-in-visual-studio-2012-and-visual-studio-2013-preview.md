Lately I've been working a lot with LUA and C++ code. As usual I've been using Visual Studio and it hindered me that there was no syntax high-lighting and that on Google I couldn't find any up to plug-in that worked in VS 2012/2013 (yeah I'm working on the cutting edge at the moment.

After a lot of searching I found <a title="Crydev forums" href="http://www.crydev.net/viewtopic.php?f=314&amp;t=88203">this post</a>, I then figured out that VSIX files are just plain zip files with XML and other data stored inside. After some tweaking I present you 2 Visual Studio plugins. One for 2012 and one for 2013 (preview) that adds proper syntax high-lighting.

<a title="VS2012 version" href="http://roy-t.nl/files/LuaSyntaxHighlighting.zip">Download the Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 Version (zipped)</a>

<em>(Update 2: Some users were still not able to download the files because the VSIX files were interpreted as XML, so I've uploaded a zip file instead that contains both files)</em>
