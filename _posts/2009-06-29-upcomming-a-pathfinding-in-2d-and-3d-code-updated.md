So allot of people have commented on my A* tutorial I posted here a while ago, but they've also pointed out a few flaws in the design so I've been working on a new version.

The new version also incorperates 2D AND 3D worlds so you can use this class for both, I've also optimized a bunch, made everything allot more clear replaced those dodgy ints with nice structs and fixed an unseen bug.

I hope to be able to get it online tomorrow, there's just to much to polish atm to post it right now, but I'll keep you guys updated!
