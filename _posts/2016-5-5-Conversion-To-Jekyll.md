For the last 8 years this blog has been powered by Wordpress. Though it has given me many problems I was generally quite satisfied with how it works. Unfortunately the last few years have been different. Although I've used a standard install, that was automatically updated, the blog got infected with malware on numerous occasions and even when the blog was not infected it worked terribly slow. 

Because of this I've decided to switch over my entire blog to static-html which reduced to chance of this blog ever being effected again to near 0%. It will also give it a nice speed boost. 

Of course I will not be typing HTML by hand. I've decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll generates a complete static website from posts written in markdown. 

This change is not intended to begin my entire blog from a clean slate. I've used a converter to convert all the old Wordpress posts to markdown. And it seems to work fairly well. But I still need to do some tinkering before I'm satisfied enough with the conversion before I upload it. I can also not guarantee that all old links will keep working, but I will try to accomodate that :).

In the meantime, sorry for the inconvenience!
