So in <a title="Facial Feature Detection" href="http://roy-t.nl/index.php/2012/02/24/sidestep-facial-feature-detection/">this </a>post you saw me playing with facial feature detection. I've used that to construct a robot (together with <a title="His website" href="http://slimme-handen.nl/">Ynze van der Spek</a>) that tries to mimic your facial expressions, the robot was inspired on the <a title="Mimbo page" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Mimbo-A-Friendly-Robot/">MIMBO</a> project, since ours ran on Windows instead of on an iPhone we've called it Wimbo. The robot was part of an exhibit at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen for 2 months and was then moved to Der Aa-Kerk in Groningen for the '<a href="http://www.denachtvankunstenwetenschap.nl/">Nacht van de Kunst en Wetenschap</a>'  (<a href="http://www.denachtvankunstenwetenschap.nl/en/">Night of Arts &amp; Sciences</a>).

Wimbo was build for <a title="Science LinX" href="http://www.sciencelinx.nl">Science LinX</a>, an institute of the faculty of Natural Sciences at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen that tries to inspire pupils to choose a career in science. The photos were made by <a title="Hugo's website" href="http://www.hugomatic.nl/">Hugomatic</a>


<em>Btw, as you see this is not the third, and final, Farseer Physics tutorial, unfortunately I haven't had much time to program on personal projects lately, but I promise I will try to finish it as soon as I can. Can't give any ETAs though!</em>
