So there's a new tutorial up on SgtConker's, by yours truly. I explore the way Diablo 3 cuts away archways and roofs and how you can mimic the technique in XNA

Anyway the tutorial is posted <a href="http://www.madgamedev.com/post/2012/05/19/Cutting-away-archways-and-roofs-to-keep-the-player-character-visible.aspx">here</a>.
